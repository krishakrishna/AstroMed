# AstroMed

AstroMed is an advanced AI-driven health monitoring system designed to ensure astronaut well-being on long-duration space missions. By integrating machine learning, biometric tracking, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision, AstroMed provides real-time health risk predictions and early detection of potential medical issues. Unlike traditional health monitoring, which relies on periodic checkups, AstroMed enables continuous, autonomous monitoring, making it ideal for missions beyond Earth, where immediate medical intervention is limited. With applications in deep-space exploration, Moon and Mars missions, and even remote locations on Earth, AstroMed is revolutionizing the future of space medicine.
